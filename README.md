HealthStat Solutions: Comprehensive Healthcare Analytics Dashboard

Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive Power BI dashboard developed by HealthStat Solutions. The dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of healthcare data from two datasets: 'Patient Medical Records' and 'Hospital Treatment Details'.

Background

In the healthcare industry, data-driven decisions are essential for improving patient care and optimizing hospital operations. This project aims to analyze these datasets, uncovering trends and insights that can enhance patient outcomes and hospital efficiency.

Objective

Leverage Power BI for a deep dive into healthcare datasets, involving meticulous data cleaning, sophisticated data modeling, and advanced DAX analytics. The goal is to create an interactive dashboard that presents a cohesive narrative of the healthcare data, providing valuable insights for healthcare providers.

Data Sources

The project utilizes two primary datasets:

Patient Medical Records: This dataset contains detailed information on patients, including age, gender, blood type, diagnosis, treatments, admission and discharge dates, and total bills.
Hospital Treatment Details: This dataset provides insights into the hospitals treating these patients, including treating doctor, room number, daily costs, treatment types, and recovery ratings.
Both datasets are imported into Power BI for comprehensive analysis.
