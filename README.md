**HealthStat Solutions: Comprehensive Healthcare Analytics Dashboard**


Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive Power BI dashboard developed by HealthStat Solutions. The dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of healthcare data from two datasets: 'Patient Medical Records' and 'Hospital Treatment Details'.

Background

In the healthcare industry, data-driven decisions are essential for improving patient care and optimizing hospital operations. This project aims to analyze these datasets, uncovering trends and insights that can enhance patient outcomes and hospital efficiency.

Objective

Leverage Power BI for a deep dive into healthcare datasets, involving meticulous data cleaning, sophisticated data modeling, and advanced DAX analytics. The goal is to create an interactive dashboard that presents a cohesive narrative of the healthcare data, providing valuable insights for healthcare providers.

Data Sources

The project utilizes two primary datasets:

Patient Medical Records: This dataset contains detailed information on patients, including age, gender, blood type, diagnosis, treatments, admission and discharge dates, and total bills.
Hospital Treatment Details: This dataset provides insights into the hospitals treating these patients, including treating doctor, room number, daily costs, treatment types, and recovery ratings.
Both datasets are imported into Power BI for comprehensive analysis.

Tools

Power BI: Used for data import, cleaning, modeling, and visualization. Power BI's powerful data visualization and business intelligence capabilities enable the creation of interactive dashboards.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Employed for advanced analytics and complex calculations within Power BI to derive deeper insights from the data.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Data Importing and Initial Examination: Import the datasets into Power BI and perform a preliminary examination to identify data quality issues or inconsistencies.
Merging Datasets: Merge the 'Patient Medical Records' and 'Hospital Treatment Details' datasets using a suitable key column, ensuring accuracy and retention of all necessary information.
Handling Missing and Irrelevant Data: Identify and address missing data, duplicates, and irrelevant data points to ensure data quality.
Data Type Conversion: Convert 'AdmissionDate' and 'DischargeDate' to appropriate date formats and calculate the length of stay for each patient.
Categorizing Age Groups: Create a new column categorizing patients into age groups (e.g., Child, Adult, Senior) for more granular analysis.

Analysis Focus Areas

Treatment Costs: Calculate the total cost of treatment for each patient and identify the most expensive treatments on average.
Gender and Diagnosis Distribution: Analyze the distribution of genders across different diagnoses to identify patterns or trends.
Blood Type Prevalence: Investigate the distribution of blood types among patients.
Recovery Ratings: Use DAX to analyze the average recovery rating by treatment type and identify which treatment has the highest average recovery rating.
Hospital Utilization: Calculate the average number of patients per room in each hospital and determine which hospital has the highest utilization.
Doctor's Patient Load: Analyze the number of patients treated by each doctor and explore correlations with recovery ratings.
Treatment Effectiveness: Compare length of stay against recovery ratings for different treatment types to identify the most effective treatments.
Cost Analysis by Hospital: Investigate the average treatment cost per patient in each hospital to identify the highest and lowest cost hospitals.
Patient Admission Trends: Analyze trends in patient admissions over time to identify any seasonal patterns.
Age and Recovery Correlation: Explore the correlation between patient age and recovery rating.

Strategic Recommendations

Improving Treatment Effectiveness: Recommend best practices based on treatment effectiveness analysis to enhance patient outcomes.
Optimizing Hospital Operations: Suggest operational improvements based on hospital performance metrics, patient load, and room utilization.
Cost Management: Provide insights into cost implications of different medical procedures to help hospitals manage resources efficiently.
Patient Care Strategies: Use findings from demographic and recovery trend analysis to inform patient care strategies.
Doctor Performance Insights: Offer recommendations on managing doctor workloads and improving recovery ratings based on analysis of doctor performance.
